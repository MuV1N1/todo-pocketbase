# TODO List
This project is my personaly first JavaScript and HTML project! 
I coded it in my school intership! I personally got a nice time at Fricke in the e-comerce department. I learned much!!!

It is possible that not everything is written in the right JavaScript HTML or css syntax. 

I can tell you when you want to get an developer in future. You have to learn things and if something don't work instantly NEVER give up you get it in future!!!

This is the last commit on this Project for a long period I currently don't know how long this period will be!

Vite (French word for "fast", pronounced `/vit/`) is a new breed of frontend build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It consists of two major parts:

- A dev server that serves your source files over [native ES modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), with [rich built-in features](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html) and astonishingly fast [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement).

- A [build command](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html) that bundles your code with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org), pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

In addition, Vite is highly extensible via its [Plugin API](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin.html) and [JavaScript API](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-javascript.html) with full typing support.
